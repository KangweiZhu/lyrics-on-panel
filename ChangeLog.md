## [v1.1.0] Deprecated
> Not usable version for spotify users. But it will be still able to download at the File(Archived) section of this page https://www.pling.com/p/2148373.

## [v1.1.1 & v1.1.2] 05/28/2024 BRING THIS WIDGET BACK TO LIVE IN PLASMA6!
### Key Points
1. Usable version. Apologize for uploading the previous broken version.
2. Fixed the issue with failing to display lyrics from Spotify.
3. Refactored the logic for displaying lyrics and removed unnecessary code.

## [v.1.1.3] 05/29/2024 Major Bug Fix, Improve Accuracy.
1. Removed the Developer-note section in the configuration page and added a Changelog & tutorial section.
2. Now, if you switch from YesPlayMusic mode to Spotify mode, we will first pause the currently playing music from YesPlayMusic. Then, you need to manually open Spotify and click the play (resume) button. Vice versa.
3. Fixed the problem where lyrics from Spotify would still appear even when the mode is switched to YesPlayMusic.
4. Now you can control the width of this widget on the configuration page.
